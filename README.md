## Background and Motivation:

As the AI named AlphaGo defeated the world's best Go player in 2016, AIs are brought into the classroom to individualize learning in the form of adaptive learning. They analyze the students and note their weaknesses and strengths, then change the course around so that students can polish up areas which they may be struggling with. They also respond to the students' needs and personalize the course to best fit their talents.

## Topics:

Interested topics include, but are not limited to:


  1) Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Practice: How AI powers Adaptive Education
  
  2) New model or algorithm for knowledge assessment and learning
  
  3) Quantitative assessment, such as by comparison experiment, of the effectiveness of AI powered adaptive education system
  
  4) Clustering algorithm for the profiling of the users of adaptive education system
  
  5) Applying research from cognition, perception, and memory to design and evaluate adaptive learning technology for education
  
  6) Using learning science theories and learning analytics to conduct research that inform adaptive instructional design

## Program:

ACML is the most influential conference about machine learning in asia pacific area. We take this chance to present the most recent developing of machine learning technology used in education.The sharing and suggestion of such technology is welcome. If you are interested, please contact the organizers of this workshop. The workshop will consist of invited talks, presentations and discussion sessions spread over a one-day period.
